/**
 * File Cache (FC) is introduced to solve the problem that the local disk cannot hold
 * the entire dataset on remote store. It maintains a node level view of index files with priorities,
 * caching only those index files needed by queries. The file with the lowest priority
 * (Least Recently Used) in the FC is replaced first.
 *
 * <p>The two main interfaces of FC are put and get. When a new file index input is added
 * to the file cache, the file will be added at cache head, which means it has the highest
 * priority.
 * <p> The get function does not add file to cache, but it promotes the priority
 * of a given file (since it makes it the most recently used).
 *
 * <p>Once file cache reaches its capacity, it starts evictions. Eviction removes the file
 * items from cache tail and triggers a callback to clean up the file from disk. The
 * cleanup process also includes closing fileâ€™s descriptor.
